==========
What is this and how do I play it?

What this Mod Does:
Every item you pickup is added to your "count". This is displayed on screen at all times.
Whichever player has the highest count at the end wind (intended to be played on a time limit).
When you die, 1/3 of your items are lost and stored in the weapon you drop for someone else to pick up.
-This will not occur if you are holding a blaster or grenade at the time.
The player in first glows blue to draw attention

Weapon mods:
blaster - each blaster bolt steals 1 item from the target.
grenade - if the grenade hits the target, it steals 3 item. If there are not enough, it simply explodes as usual.
railgun - If it kills the target, they will respawn with the same kind of blue shell as the player in first has.
shotgun - Bullets neutrelize the effects of powerups from this mod
chaingun and machinegun - un-blue anyone who isn't in first

powerups:
armor jacket - lets you hold onto your items if you die
(can be found at the top of the circular outdoor area on The Edge next to the grenade launcher)
armor combat - triples the amount of things you steal
(can be found in the room with the chaingun on The Edge)
ammo pack makes it so any time you deal damage, you steal items (kinda overpowered oops)
(can be found in the room with the chaingun on The Edge)
